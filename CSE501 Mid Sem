NOTE: Answer all the questions. All parts of a question should be answered in one place. Any missing or wrong data may be assumed suitably giving proper justification.
1. Solve the recurrence relation: T(n)=2T(n-1)+n+2" for n>=1 and T(0) = 0. (4)
2. Write an efficient algorithm to generate a second best minimum spanning tree for a given weighted graph. Also, derive the time complexity of your algorithm. (3+1)
3. Define spanning tree. Derive the expression for the total number of spanning trees in a complete graph containing N vertices. (1+3)
4. Devise a dynamic programming method to print a longest increasing subsequence of a sequence containing N integers. (4)
5. Illustrate the working of a branch and bound method to solve 15-puzzle problem. (4)
